What is Gnarfle?

Gnarfle is a software platform which aids job seekers in choosing the best job title and words for their resume to be selected by today’s modern Applicant Tracking Systems. (ATS) 
Gnarfle creates a word count table for a given job description. Users can then examine that list to determine what, if any, important words are missing in their resume or other job application documentation.  In Gnarfle, a user can enter a phrase such as “Technical Writer” or “Java Developer.” Gnarfle then automatically scans for that job phrase in indeed.com across the top 20 metro markets in the US.  The job descriptions matching that phrase are saved to a database.  All job descriptions in the database are parsed, and a frequency count of individual words in the database is generated into an Excel File. 
Todays ATS weight heavily job titles.  It is important to phrase your job title such that it matches the job title of as many job descriptions as possible. Gnarfle allows users to enter different phrases, such as: Marketing Manager, Manager of Marketing, Marketing Leader, etc. then searches the database for all permutations of the words to determine which words bring up the most job titles.
